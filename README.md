programs to be accessed through it using Java. :computer:


#### To get started

- First clone the repo and import it into your favorite Java IDE.

- After you import it run the class called "Main".

- 2 windows should appear to you, one that's the desktop and one that's the CMD.

- Try navigating through the files and folders by clicking on them and to go back just press the back button up there.

- After you change in your current view or folder by creating files through the CMD use the refresh button to refresh the view.

#### Supported commands through our CMD

- ls > lists all files and folders in your current directory

- cd path > changes directory to a given path i.e cd desktop/joe

- pwd > tells you your parent directory i.e if you're inside desktop/joe then your parent directory would be desktop.

- touch fileName > creates a File with name fileName

- closeFile fileName > closes File with name fileName

- deleteFile path/fileName > deletes File with fileName

- create folderName > creates a Folder with name folderName

- deleteFolder path/folderName > deletes Folder with folderName and all of its child folders and files

- play musicPath > plays your favorite music at a given path i.e play music/music.wav would play music.wav

- stop musicPath > stops your currently playing music at a given path i.e stop music/music.wav would stop music.wav
