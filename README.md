#### Supported commands through our CMD

- cd path > changes directory to a given path i.e cd desktop/joe

- pwd > tells you your parent directory i.e if you're inside desktop/joe then your parent directory would be desktop.

- touch fileName > creates a File with name fileName

- closeFile fileName > closes File with name fileName

- deleteFile path/fileName > deletes File with fileName

- create folderName > creates a Folder with name folderName

- deleteFolder path/folderName > deletes Folder with folderName and all of its child folders and files

- play musicPath > plays your favorite music at a given path i.e play music/music.wav would play music.wav
